			<h1>Essential Parts List - Image Intensifier Tubes</h1>

			<p style="text-align: left">
				<br>
				This is going to be the trickier part to source. Since we’re looking to keep the unit as a budget build, eBay and local forums are going to be your best friend for tracking these down
				<br>
				<br>
				There are two types of image intensifier tubes for the PVS-14 monocular; the MX-10160 and the MX-11769.
				<br>
				<br>
				The biggest and only difference between these two units is manual gain vs no manual gain. Gain in this instance is going to be controlling the brightness of the viewing screen in the image intensifier tube.
				<br>
				<br>
				If you have the MX-11769, you will have the option for manual gain control via a knob on the front of the PVS-14 unit. The MX-11769 series will have a ‘pig-tail’ connector that allows for this. The MX-10160 series will not have the ‘pig-tail’ connection. In fact, you can actually convert the MX-11769 into an MX-10160 by de-soldering this ‘pigtail’ if need be.
				<br>
				<br>
				Used units can range anywhere between $400-$1500. Do be aware that these units typically will have some type of blemish. Units that are on the lower end of the spectrum typically will have more severe blemishes in Zones 1-2 (aka center/near center). Depending on what your use/application for the PVS-14 will be, you will want to try to be cognisant of what zone the blemish (if any) may be in.

			<h1>Mission Dependent Parts - Arms and Mounts</h1>

			<p style="text-align: left">
				<br>
				Generally speaking if you’re looking at PVS-14s, you’re more than likely considering some type of helmet capable mounting system. Once again, there are two major components to consider: Arms and Mounts. 
				<br>
				<br>
				J-Arms will be the most common 'Arm' used to adapt the PVS-14 housing to some type of 'Mount.' These J-Arms will screw into the threaded hole on the PVS-14 body and will line up with two electrical contacts. These will give the J-Arm the ability to power down the PVS-14 when the operator flips the 'Mount' to the up position; saving on power usage. You can typically find them ranging between $30-$250 used depending on brand (eg. USGI vs. Wilcox).
				<br>
				<br>
				'Mounts' on the other hand when used in conjunction with an 'Arm,'' will allow the operator to attach a PVS-14 to a helmet mounted shroud. Be aware to do some research on which 'Arms' work with what 'Mounts.'' For example, USGI J-Arms will work with Norotos Rhino II/Wilcox G11 mounts, but will NOT work with Wilcox G24 mounts. You can find these ranging in price drastically, but usually these will run between $80-$400 used depending on brand (eg. USGI vs. Wilcox).
