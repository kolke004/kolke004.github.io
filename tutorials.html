			<h1>Building your PVS-14 Monocular</h1>

			<h1>Let's start building!</h1>

			<p style="text-align: left">The tools you will need to assemble your PVS-14 are not specialized. In fact, you should have most if not all of them lying around your house already!</p><br>
			
			<div style="text-align: left">
				<br>
					&bull;Allen wrenches (SAE) 0.050 & 5/64
				<br>
					&bull;Flat head screwdriver (small)
				<br>
					&bull;Lens paper
				<br>
					&bull;Plastic card that can be cut up (eg. hotel keycard)
				<br>
					&bull;Dust Off (compressed air)
				<br>
			</div>
			<p style="text-align: left">
				It is key to cut the plastic card into a width that will fit in the housing (specifically the eyepiece assembly area). This will make your life significantly eaiser for securely tightening the tube retaining ring later.

			<h1>Housing Connections</h1>

			<p style="text-align: left">
				<br>
				Most Monocular Housing units will have the Power Knob and Manual Gain Knobs already installed. In the case these are not installed, both have a small set screw/pin. You will need the 0.050 SAE Allen wrench to tighten them down. Take care to not strip the hex sockets.
				<br>
				<br>
				The objective lens is also normally installed. But if it is not, you will simply need to screw in the objective lens. Prior to doing so, make sure to clean the back of the lens.
				<br>
				<br>
				With the Monocular Housing set, connect the Battery Housing to the Monocular Housing. The inside of the Monocular Housing will have two small male pin connectors. With the Battery Housing pigtail, connect the two leads onto the two pins
				<br>
			</p>

		<div class="section-6 box">
			
			<h1>Image Intensifier Installation</h1>

			<p style="text-align: left">
				<br>
				Once these two units are connected, take a look in the Monocular Housing. Inside you will see a small metal pin that is epoxied to the housing. This component is an anti-rotation pin for the image intensifier tube.
				<br>
				<br>
				If you have an MX-11769 series tube, ensure to put the pigtail in first then insert the tube. There is a small notch on the tube. Line this up with the pin in the Monocular Housing. Spray the tube with DustOff prior to fully seating the tube.
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>NOTE: If you have an MX-11769 series tube, you will want to continue reading. If you have an MX-10160 tube, skip to the HOUSING ASSEMBLY section below.</b> 
				<br>
				<br>
				The MX-11769 units have a pigtail with a small 4 pin chip. These correspond to 4 holes in the Battery Housing PCB. Plug the male connectors to the female connectors. Simply press down gently until the chip sits flush to the board.
				<br>

			<h1>Housing Assembly</h1>

			<p style="text-align: left">
				<br>
				Carefully fold the Battery and Monocular Housing into each other, ensuring the ribbon cables do not get pinched.
				<br>
				<br>
				Note that on the battery compartment side of the housing, one of the screw ears has a cutout for the battery cap dummy cord. Make sure you place the dummy cord here prior to screwing the two housing halves together with your 5/64 Allen wrench.
				<br>
				<br>
				Install the light pipe right side up. Note that on the light pipe, it will state “up” on the correct side that faces up. There is also a small cutout/notch on the light pipe that will line up with the internals of the housing.
				<br>
				<br>
				You will then install the tube retaining ring. Using the old plastic card (cut to size so it is as wide as the retaining ring) screw the tube retaining ring into place.
				<br>
				<br>
				Install the eyepiece assembly carefully as the polymer threads are made of polymer. Spray the eyepiece with DustOff to clear any particulates.
				<br>
				<br>
				Finally, remove the purge screw. Carefully spray into the purge hole with DustOff and quickly reinstall the purge screw. Allegedly, this DIY method of purging will reduce the susceptibility of the unit fogging. However, if you live in a dry weather climate you don’t need to purge the PVS-14.

			<h1>Function Testing</h1>

			<p style="text-align: left">
				<br>
				With your PVS-14 now built, you will need to function test. 
				<br>
				<br>
				Be sure to either, one - do this at nighttime or two - use a daylight filter cap in daytime operations (in a low light room) to avoid blowing out your image intensifier tube.
				<br>
				<br>
				Turn the unit on and look through the eyepiece. Adjust the objective lens first (the front lens) focusing on something approximately 10ft away. Then adjust the rear eyepiece.
				<br>
				<br>
				Congratulations! You've built your first PVS-14 Monocular! Now go out to enjoy your unfair advantage and own the night!
